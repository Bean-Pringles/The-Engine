Print

The print command can print varibles or strings.
It prints literal text only if wrapped in parentheses.
This does not require strings.

It prints varibles only if it is outide parentheses.

# let x = 5
# 
# print (X Equals: )
# print x 

It does not require a space between the print and the parentheses,
it is purely optional.
