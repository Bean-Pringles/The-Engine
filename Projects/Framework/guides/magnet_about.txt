About Magnet

Magnet is a torrent clone that can fetch
optimized downloads through a special file type,
a mgn file.

Magnet uses the sha256 key to check if the file is
the same as the download like. 
It can also run the installer after downloading.

Magnet can be used to both run and create mgn files.
