Return

The return command is used in Rachet to return
a value of a function. If that function was called 
as an assignment to a varible, the return function
assigns the chosen arguement to the varible, 
much like any other launguage's return.

# fn main() {
#     ley y = 5;
#     let x = testFunc(y);
# 
#     print(x); # Prints 10
# }
# 
# fn testFunc(val1) {
#     let z = val1 * 2;
# 
#     return z; 
# }
