Changed Syntax

Nim++ changes multiple things from Nim including:

----- Curly Brackets -----

Curly brackets replace the double space indent
into curly brackets like most other low level code.

----- Semicolins -----

While Nim++ doesn't require semicolins,
the compiler automatically removes them.

----- Echo to Print -----

Nim++ changes the echo command to, 
much like the python version of it,
print and surronded by parentheses.

------ Commas to Plus Signs -----

Nim++ makes it instead of sperating 
arguements in a print/echo statement 
with a comma, you do it with a plus.

----- Tabs -----

Tabs are automatically removed
and replaced with proper Nim synatx.
