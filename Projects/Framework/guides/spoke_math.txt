Math Commands

The math commands do math within the 
spoke launguage.

----- Math ----- 

The math command can do:

addition

subtraction

multiplication

division

It can print the output and assign it to a varible.
It takes the arguements of the expression, 
silent or loud, and varible to assign to.

# math 5 * 6 loud x # Prints 30 and assigns it to x
# math x / 10 y # Doesn't print and makes y equal 3

----- Round ----- 

#round exampleVar 2 exampleVar2
# or round exampleVar 2 loud

The round command takes the varible to round, 
decimal place to round too, and either loud or
another varible to store it in.

The round command takes the specified varible
and rounds it to the given number of decimal points.

# let pi = 3.14159
# round pi 2 piRound
# print piRound # Prints 3.14
#
# let e = 2.71828
# round e 3 loud # Prunts 2.718

----- Sqrt ----- 

The sqrt command square roots the number
and either prints it or stores it to a varible.

It takes the arguements of the varible to square root
and output varible (Could also have loud instead of output var)

# let x = 9
# let y = 25
#
# sqrt x z
# print z # Prints 3
#
# sqrt y loud # Prints 5

----- Mod ----- 

Creates a varible based off of an operation on an old varible.

It can use the operations of:

abs

floor

ceiling 

sin 

cos 

tan 

asin 

acos

atan

The command creates a varible like let, 
but you wrap the modified varible in parentheses
next to the selected command.

# let x = -10
# mod y = abs(x)
# print y # Prints 10
# 
# mod z = cos(x)
# print z # Prints -0.83907...
