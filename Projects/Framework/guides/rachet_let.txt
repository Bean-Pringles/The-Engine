Let

The let command creates a varible.
This varible can be i32, float, or string.
Let can do math and string operators

use crate::iso

# fn main() {
#     let x = 5;
#     let y = 5 * x;
#     let z = y * 4;
#
#     print(z); # Prints 100
#
#     z = 101;
#
#     print(z); # Prints 101
# }

When you edit a varibles value, it doesn't require let.
