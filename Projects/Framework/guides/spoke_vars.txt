Varibles Commands

Varibles come in lists, i32, and strings.
They can be promoted at runtime
and is very similar to python syntax.

----- Let ------

Varibles are made using the let command.
They can either have a set value,
or can be based off other varibles.

# let x = 3
# let y = x * 5
# let z = ["3", "Hello", "World"]
# let a = "Hello, World!"
#
# print z # Prints 3, Hello, and World
# print a # Prints "Hello, World!"

----- Inc ------

Inc takes 2 arguments, varible name and how much to increase by.
It increases the given varible by the given number,
a shorthand for the repetive task.

# let x = 5
# inc x 4
# print x # Prints 9

----- Dec -----

Dec is almost the same as inc, 
but it decreases it by the given amount instead of increasing.

# let x = 5
# dec x 4
# print x # Prints 1

----- Compare -----

Compare takes the input of two varibles and prints the result.
It can be equal, greater than, or less than.

# let x = 3
# let y = 4
# compare x y # Prints less than

----- Delete -----

The delete command deletes the specified varible.
The varible can no longer be used after being deleted.

# let x = 5
# delete x
# print x # Errors out.

----- Swap -----

Swap swaps the value of the two specified varibles.

# let x = 3
# let y = 4
# swap x y
# print x # Prints 4
# print y # Prints 3

----- Toggle -----

Toggle toggles a varible between 0/1 or true/false.
If the varible is equal to 1, it changes it to 0,
smae with the reverse.
If the varible is true it changes it to false, and vice versa.

# let x = 1
# let y = "false"
#
# toggle x
# toggle y
#
# print x # Prints 0
# print y # Prints true
