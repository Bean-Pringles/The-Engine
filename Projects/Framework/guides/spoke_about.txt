About Spoke

Spoke is a light weight Python alternitive
that has a mix of syntax between Python, TI-Basic, and Rust.
Spoke was mainly more of a prototype of rachet but can still
hold its own against most other indie launguages.

Spoke has a modular command system and a package manager.
You can even make your own commands and have other people install them.

As of writing this I haven't worked on spoke in around 2 months, 
so the guides may not be that accurate.

It has a custom text editor and a super cool logo! 
Let's see what you can make!
