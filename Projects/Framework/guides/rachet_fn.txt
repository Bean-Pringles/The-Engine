Fn

Fn makes a function with arguements of the function main
and function arguements.

Functions require being wrapped in curly brackets,
starting at the last charecter of the first line, 
and be on it's own line at the bottom.

# fn main() {
#     let x = 5;
#     let y = 9;
#
#     let z = add(x, y); 
# }
# 
# fn add(num1, num2) {
#     let total = num1 + num2;
#
#     return total;
# }

Calling functions do not require fn, 
that is just for declaring them,
to call a function you simply put your function name
next to parentheses with the arguements inside.

Function arguements are seperated by commas.
