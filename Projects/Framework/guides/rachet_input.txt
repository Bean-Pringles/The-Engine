Input

The input command is used to get a user input
and assign it to a varible.
It can assign whatever type of varible you choose
by using the : <var type> mythod

# use crate::iso
#
# fn main() {
#   let stringInput: string = input("What is your name? ");
#   let numberInput: i32 = input("What is your age? ");
#   
#   print(stringInput + " is " + numberInput); # Prints <name> is <age>
# }

The input command takes the argument of the prompt,
so input("Hello") would print hello
and ask for an input
