About The Engine

The Engine is an ecosystem written by Bean Pringles.
It was made as a way for Bean Pringles to connect
his projects, but without each one being 
just another tool for a diffrent project.

It was made with blood, sweat, lots of tears, 
and even more ChatGBT tokens. 
It has many days of work put into it,
almost 20k lines of code, over 100 commits,
88% python, 7% Rust, 2% Nim, and 
totals more than 12MB in size.

The main goal of the engine was to have
an entire developer ecosystem in a single repository.
This machine has been made by one man
spending countless hours and Claude tokens
to get it in this fully tested, working state.

To be honest, this is like 80% AI,
so do with that information as you wish.

Let's see what you can make!
