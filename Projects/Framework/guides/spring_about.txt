About Spring

Spring is a browser with many features
such as:

History

Bookmarks

Settings

Custom Search Engine

Developer Tools

Themes

It uses PyQt5 and QtWebEngine as its
rendering engines.

Its goal was to unify every developer tool 
you could possibly need under one ecosystem.
