Match Statements 

Match statements are used as an easier way to find a case.
They take the case and match it to it's value,
so, for example, you input something that is equal to 1, 
it would find 1 in the list of matches and run the 
following code seperated by a comma.

If you need more than one line of code,
you can call a function and put your code inside the function.

# use crate::iso
# fn main() {
#     let stringVar = "hello";
#     
#     match (stringVar) {
#         "hello", print("You said hello!"); # Would print "You said hello!"
#         "world", print("You said world!");
#         "quit", print("Goodbye!");
#     }
# }
