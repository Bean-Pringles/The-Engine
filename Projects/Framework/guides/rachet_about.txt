About Rachet

Rachet is a compiler based programming launguage 
designed for school students to design thier custom
operating system easily and without the normal rigors.

Rachet has a high level synatx similar to python
and a bit like rust. This simple synatx is essential
to hooking students onto OS Dev.

Rachet is an easy to use, plug and play launguage that
has almost limitless possibilities.

Rachet was also made by an indie developer seeking a way
to easily reiterate on their rust operating system (Cog OS).

Have fun, get thinking, and let's see what you can make!
