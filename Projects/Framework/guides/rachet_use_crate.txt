Use & Crate

Use specifies to use a libray.
Check List of Libraries to see what can be imported.
The compiler uses the first use to find what
the file type it should be compiled to. 
So use crate::iso would compile to an iso file
and use crate::bin would make a bin file.

# use crate::iso # Compiles to an iso file
#
# fn main() {
#   print("Hello, World!");   
# }

Crate specifies that you are importing bits of code.
