If Else Statements

If and else if statements require a "then" after the condition.
It requires curly brackets to show the scope of the if statement.
It also supports the operators ==, !=, <<, >>, <=, >=, =<, and =>,
and the logic flow of and, or, and not.

# if (x == y and not z >> 5) then {
#     print (Match)
# } else if (x != y) then {
#     print (Mismatch)
# } else {
#     print (Fallback)
# }
