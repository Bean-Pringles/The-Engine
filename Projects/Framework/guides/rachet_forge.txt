About Forge

Forge is an interpreter for rachet,
it works exactly the same except each
command has an alternate way of doing things.

For example, the print command just calls
the python print, not the vga buffer.

Forge runs on top of another operating system
and is not an independet operating System.

It is used for quick prototyping
and to get around compiling each time.

It also includes all the features of
the Core version of Rachet.
