If Else Statements

If statements are used to see if a variable
or a piece of data compares to another 
piece of data. 

If statements can use ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, &&, ||, and not.

== - Checks if equal to another condition

!= - Checks if not equal to another condition

< - Checks if less than another condition

> - Checks if greater than another condition

<= - Checks if less than or equal to another condition

> - Checks if greater than or equal to another condition

&& - Checks if both conditions between it are true

|| - Returns a Boolean of true or false

not - Makes the condition opposite of its current statements

They take in their argument and evaluates them, and if true,
executes the code underneath it. If it is false and has an else if, 
it will evaluate the else if the same way it evaluates the if.
And, if all above if and else if statements are false, it runs the 
else statement at the bottom of the code.

# use crate::iso
#
# fn main {
#     let score = 85;
#     
#     if (score >= 90) { # Evaluates the arguments inside the parentheses
#         print("Grade: A");
#     } else if (score >= 80) {
#         print("Grade: B");
#     } else if (score >= 70) {
#         print("Grade: C");
#     } else {
#         print("Grade: F");
#     }    
# }

If the item is a string inside of the arguments,
make sure to wrap it in quotes, so instead of:
if (stringVar == Hello) {}
put:
if (stringVar == "Hello") {}
