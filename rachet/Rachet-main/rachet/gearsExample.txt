Here are some practical Gears command examples:
Basic Development
bash# Compile your OS kernel with real-time output
gears compile kernel.rx
# Shows live: "Parsing... Generating assembly... Building bootloader... Creating ISO..."

# Get project info and ASCII art
gears fetch
File Compression & Management
bash# Compress source files for backup/sharing
gears compress main.rx driver.rx bootloader.rx
gears compress *.rx --noreplace    # Keep originals

# Uncompress project files
gears uncompress project.rxc
gears uncompress *.rxc --txt       # Extract as .txt files

# Toggle between file formats
gears transform main.txt           # Becomes main.rx
gears transform *.rx               # All become .txt files
Batch Operations
bash# Compress entire project folder
gears compress src/*.rx libs/*.rx --noreplace

# Restore all compressed files
gears uncompress backup/*.rxc

# Convert text drafts to Rachet format
gears transform drafts/*.txt
Development Workflow
bash# Quick compile-test cycle
gears compile main.rx              # Build and see live output
# ... test in VM ...
gears compress main.rx             # Archive working version
gears transform backup.txt         # Start next iteration
