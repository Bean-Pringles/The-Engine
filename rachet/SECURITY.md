# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This project doesn’t really focus on security.  
In other words: **everything is “secure” only in a very relative sense.**

If you discover a real vulnerability, it’s probably worth reporting, no matter which version it’s in.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a vulnerability:

1. Open a new **GitHub Issue**.
2. Include a **clear, detailed description** of the problem.
3. Add **steps to reproduce** it so I can test it myself.
4. If possible, explain the potential impact or suggest a fix.

I can’t guarantee a quick response, but I’ll do my best to check it out.
