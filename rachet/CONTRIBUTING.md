# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project!

This project is mostly a **solo effort**, so I’m generally not looking for contributions.  
That said, if you want to submit a pull request, please keep these points in mind:

1. **Substantial Changes Only**  
   - Please submit **meaningful, non-trivial** changes (e.g., a new driver, a major bug fix, or a significant performance improvement).  
   - Small tweaks, style changes, or partial implementations will usually be declined.

2. **Thorough Testing**  
   - All code must be **fully tested** before being submitted.  
   - I only publish **working, tested code**, so PRs that break the build or introduce untested features will be rejected.

3. **Explain Your Work**  
   - Include a **clear and detailed explanation** of what you changed and why.  
   - If it’s a new feature (like a USB driver), describe how to test and use it.

4. **Acceptance Is Not Guaranteed**  
   - I want to keep the project’s direction consistent, so the chances of a PR being accepted are low unless it fills a major gap.

Thanks for understanding!
