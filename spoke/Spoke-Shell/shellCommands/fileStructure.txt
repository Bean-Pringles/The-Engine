The proper file structure for making your own commands is:
1. The only thing ran is the run function
2. If it has user arguements, it must say what it does if the user doesnt specify anything.
3. While optional, have a comment at the top that specifies the file path from the shell helps
   # commands/exampleCommand.py
4. The file name is the commands name, so ls would be ls.py

It would look like:
#commands/exampleCommand.py
import os

def run(args):
    if not args:
        print("Usage: exampleCommand <exampleCommandFile.txt>")
        return

    print("Command Ran")

**The return in if not in args catches it if it doesn't have any args so you don't need to have
an if statement over the command*
