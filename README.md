## The Engine

This is a software suite of all my projects.

The goal is to have a single unified repository for all things relating to The Engine Ecosystem.

Everything in this repository has been fully tested and guarenteed to work. 

Every so often I will be updating it with stable releases, meaning it will recieve updates, but not as much as the main repositories.

## Setup:

Run fullSetup.py which runs each setup script on it's own.

## Repositories Pulled From

https://github.com/Bean-Pringles/rachet

https://github.com/Bean-Pringles/spoke

https://github.com/Bean-Pringles/cog-os

Please note that these repos have been discontinued and are only supported here.

## Documnentation

Most of the features of this ecosystem is documented in Framework.

## License 

Everything in here is licensed under the license of the repository it came from. 

For example, the rachet folder would be licensed under the license of the rachet repository. 

## Disclaimer

Do not move any of the files or there is a chance that things will break,
just keep the directory how it is.

If it ever breaks, it probably works on my machine.
